This is a first post.  There are many others like it, but this is mine.

After nearly two decades on the production side of newspapers, namely ad and page layout, I've reached a milestone.

In 2011, I was laid off from a newspaper job, back then my goal was to start a website production business.  Nothing big, nothing complicated, I mainly wanted to do the kind of thing I'm doing with this personal blog.  My goal was to come up with simple but elegant designs for image campaigns.  My pitch was going to be: if you're relying on websites like Facebook, the thing is, sometimes Facebook doesn't show your potential customers your new content until days later, sometimes too late.  I thought it'd be a cinch.  One kid was already in school, the other a toddler.  I'd crank out content during naptime!  When I got rolling, it'd be time to get back to daycare!

Well, that was one energetic toddler.  I did manage to do a little freelance here and there, but by and large chores, errands, and extracurriculars took precedence.

Flash forward to now: one kid has moved out, and the other will be off to college in a couple of years, and it's high time I got to thinking about what comes next. I'm itching to explore new passions and interests - and I've decided to share this journey with you. On this blog, I'll be concentrating mostly on tech stuff, primarily the things I've learned to keep things rolling over the years when the deadline is tight and the repair budget is $0.  In spring 2001 I was a wet-behind-the-ears freshly-graduated greenie, and although I was in over my head back then, I like to think I learned a thing or two here and there.

But I'm also wanting to get off of the Facebook train in particular.  It's only gotten worse.  I see posts *weeks* or even *months* later, and there's easily two *crap* posts--the divisive stuff created simply for low-effort engagement--for every post I actually want to see.

And so for that reason I'm going to try to a.) move my rants over to my own website, and b.) be more constructive than what we see on social media.

And I'm as guilty as anyone of not being productive on social media.  I'll admit it.  But I think we can all do better, don't you?
